## T1 · Rename "Current point" to "This point" and drop the speed column — done

**gate:** mechanical pass · completion `VERDICT: pass`

**changed:** `film-this-point.tsx`: eyebrow, `aria-label` and header comment read "This point"; the `Mph`/`Km/h` header cell and speed body cell are gone; `WIDE_COLUMNS` drops its `44px` track (seven tracks), `NARROW_COLUMNS` unchanged; the `unit` prop, `DistanceUnit` and `formatSpeedValue` imports removed from both the outer component and `ShotRow`. `film-tab.tsx`: only the `unit={unit}` prop on `<FilmThisPoint>` removed (the tab's own unit state still feeds `FilmRoom`). H1 spec doc section B retitled, rail-collapsed column list without `Mph`, author decision noted 2026-09-21. `shotRowCells.mph` in `film-shots.ts` untouched — the room's court readout still reads it.
