# Run log — claude/practice-sessions-teammate-opponents-bfb356

Written by `/task-next`. Do not hand-edit — the queue file is yours, this one
is the runner's. Newest entries at the bottom.

## T1 · Share match-type options and an isPracticeMatch predicate — done

**gate:** mechanical GATE PASS (lint, typecheck, full suite); completion VERDICT: pass. `tests/court-options.spec.ts:94` fails when that file runs alone, also at a clean HEAD, and passes inside the full suite — environmental, not this diff.
**changed:** new `src/lib/matches/match-type.ts` (`MATCH_TYPE_OPTIONS` Tournament / Dual Match / Practice, `isPracticeMatch` trims and lowercases); `edit-match-dialog.tsx` imports the options instead of declaring its own array; new `tests/match-type.spec.ts`.
**follow-ups:**

1. The edit dialog could branch on `isPracticeMatch` once Practice behaviour lands.
